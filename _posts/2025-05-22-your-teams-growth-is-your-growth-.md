Building products is easy compared to building people.

Over the last few years leading engineering teams, I've come to realize this fundamental truth. The question is: **How intentional are you about growing your team members?**

Here's a simple strategy that's worked for me to help my team members thrive.

## Spot the Hidden Leaders Early

A study found that teams with high engagement levels see:
- 21% greater profitability
- 59% less turnover

High-performing individuals often set the cultural tone for engagement. But don't just measure by output or velocity. Look for these key signals:

- **Curiosity** that goes beyond Jira tickets
- **Ownership** mindset, not just task completion
- **Energy** to motivate others, not drain them

### How to Identify Potential Leaders

Pay attention to team members who:
- Actively discuss what they're learning outside sprint work
- Propose ideas that extend beyond the specification
- Use phrases like "What if we approached this differently?"
- Volunteer to explore new tools or technologies

Remember: We often undervalue the "energy-givers" on our teams. The individuals who combine **High Input/Output**, **High EQ**, and **High Energy** are your true force multipliers.

## Design Growth Plans That Matter

According to LinkedIn's 2023 Workplace Learning Report, **94% of employees** would stay longer if a company invested in their development.

A meaningful growth plan should be:
- Aligned with company objectives
- Tailored to individual aspirations
- Clear about advancement requirements

### Creating Effective Growth Plans

#### 1. Start With Meaningful Conversations
Begin by understanding:
- Their 6-12 month vision
- What energizes them
- What causes frustration

#### 2. Align With Business Goals
Connect personal development to organizational needs to secure support and sponsorship.

#### 3. Create Clear Pathways
Define progression through:
- Observable behaviors
- Measurable outcomes
- Scope of influence

Consider action items like:
- Leading cross-team initiatives
- Mentoring junior developers
- Driving performance improvement projects

### Development Framework

I structure growth opportunities into three key areas:

1. **Technical Mastery**
   - Deepening technical expertise
   - Building system knowledge
   - Improving code quality

2. **Business Impact**
   - Broadening scope of influence
   - Contributing to strategic decisions
   - Driving key metrics

3. **People Skills**
   - Mentoring team members
   - Improving collaboration
   - Building team culture

## Final Thoughts

Your role as a lead isn't to be the smartest in the room.  
It's to create an environment where smart people grow.
