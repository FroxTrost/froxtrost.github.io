After years of working with high-level languages, I decided to dive into systems programming with Rust. Here's what I've learned in my first month of the journey.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers an unique combination of performance and safety. Its ownership model prevents common programming errors at compile-time, while still providing low-level control over system resources.

```rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = String::from("Hello, Rust!");
    println!("{}", greeting);
}
```

## Key Concepts I've Learned

1. **Ownership**: Rust's most unique feature. Each value has an owner, and there can only be one owner at a time.
2. **Borrowing**: Instead of transferring ownership, you can borrow references to values.
3. **Lifetimes**: Ensuring references are valid for the time they're being used.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to build a small CLI tool to better understand Rust's ecosystem. Stay tuned for more updates on my Rust journey!
